# Simple Harmonic Motion

Zachary Gillespie

In this project, you will 
 - Describe the motion of a mass attached to a simple spring that obey's Hooke's law; 
 - Write a program that solves the **ordinary differential equations** that describe this system; 
 - and assess the accuracy of the numerical methods used.
